        I graduated from BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My
        undergraduate research was in the field of Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). I am a Master of Computer Science
        student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

        recently, I worked as a backend developer at Walmart handling the Cloud Powered Checkout systems.
